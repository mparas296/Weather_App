# Weather_App

This is a simple android app based on OpenWeatherMap APIs.

On Launching the app for the first time, it will ask for Location Permissions of the device.
If permissions are provided it will display the weather of current device location.

If the user denies permission, the app will notify the user that it is a required permission and then it will show the weather of the last city that was searched on the app.
If there was no city searched previously, then it will display the search UI to search new city.

Here you can search the city of your choice and the app will display the weather data. 
Also the UI will show 3 buttons with the help of which you can choose whether to load the weather data of:

1. Current Location
2. Last Searched Location
3. New Search Location
